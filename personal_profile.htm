            <p>
              In game, she occupies a tank role. Her 200 health and 200 shields, combined with her additional shielding abilities make her a difficult target to take down.
              Furthermore, her damage is amplified proportionally with the damage she blocks with her shields, making her a larger threat the longer she is in a fight.
